|-----------|------|
|General product description | Section 2.2 [Product Functions](#22-product-functions)|
|Stack List| 3.3 [Software Interfaces](#33-software-interfaces) |
|System features|[System Features](#system-features)|

### 1.4 Product Scope

To provide a 24/7 online web application where memebers of a religious group can share their prayers. And users can remain anonymous if they desire to remain secret but requires the help of other prayers.

In the event of an integration to a bigger application, it must require NodeJs (12.11.1 or greater), a Non-RDMS (MongoDB 4.2.0 greater preferred), and React (16.10 or greater) for its basic functionality. 

### 2.2 Product Functions

* userized and authenticated users are able to complete CRUD operations and view the history on their created prayer requests.

    * can complete CRUD operations on their posted prayers
* Visitors
  * In addition to <i>All Users</i>:
    * can complete Create and Read Operations. 
* Content Administrator

### 2.4 Operating Environment
* This is a web-based application
* AWS
* React (16.10 or greater)
* Node (12.11.1 or greater)
* Auth0
* 

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
* developers will need to know the languages layed out in the 2.4 [Operating Environment](#24-operating-environment).

Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).
### 2.6 User Documentation
* The website will have a button element that will provide visual tutorial on the application uses for all types of users. 
### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies
* Assumptions:
  * Users are able to use any devices correctly to complete CRUD operations.
* Dependencies:
  * Cloud-services, AWS
  * Compatible browsers for all type of devices. 
  * Auth0
  * Stable internet connection.
